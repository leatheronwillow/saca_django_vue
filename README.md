# Introduction

This project originally started as an exploration of Vue.js written with The Options API. It was a means to try out different features such as two-way binding, v-for loops etc. This is also my first foray into combining DjangoREST with a frontend framework. Django is used on the backend to serve up the products stored in a database. I am continuing to explore the framework and intend to use it to implement my talent scouting concert.

## Features
- Search Bar
- Reactive Cart

## Bugs
- Cart resets to zero when search bar is used.
- CSS anomalies.
